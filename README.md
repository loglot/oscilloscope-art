# oscilloscope art
the place I will put my source audio for any art that I make in an oscilloscope


none of this would be possible without [osci render](https://osci-render.com/). you will need either a [downloaded](https://oscilloscopemusic.com/software/oscilloscope/), [online](https://dood.al/oscilloscope/), or real oscilloscope to view the art
